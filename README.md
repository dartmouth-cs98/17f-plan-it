# Planit

Planning a trip is hard. At the very least, you have to figure out what to do, where to eat, and how to get around from place to place. This process usually necessitates visiting a significant number of websites, potentially including TripAdvisor, Yelp, Google Maps, and travel blogs, in order to completely flesh out a trip. Wouldn’t it be nice to visit one website with the combined capabilities of these websites to create your dream itinerary? We can help you plan it!

Planit is a web application that allows users to create a fully fleshed-out itinerary for an upcoming trip. It also gives users the capability to save trips, collaborate on trips with other people, and browse other people’s trips that have been made publicly available.

## End of Term Summary
## Jeffrey Gao, Helen He, Samuel Lee, Emily Lin, Robert Sayegh, Jiyun Sung  
CS 98 17F/18W

### What worked this term

* Bringing our mockups to real life; the design of onboarding was aesthetically pleasing.
* API integrations (Google Places, Google Maps, Google Clusters, Yelp) were pretty smooth.
* Backend is stable.

### What didn't work this term

* Demo was pretty buggy.
* Lack of prompt responses by all team members.
* Unclear communication; sometimes people weren't on the same page.
* Creating the schema took many iterations.


### User testing plan

We first gave the users our little spiel on use cases for the app, then let them try it out for themselves by creating their own trip.

Some common responses that we got:

* Endless scroll for on-boarding was confusing.
* The "start trip" button for onboarding was too small and not immediately noticeable.
* The process of first clicking on a blank space and then clicking on "add" to add a new card was confusing. This will be alleviated by implementing drag-and-drop.
* Adding custom cards would be nice.
* Seeing the location of the card on the map when you click on it.

### Conclusions

People seem interested in the product that our project offers. We just have to add more functionality so that it's genuinely useful.

### Plan of attack

Goals for next term:

* Redesign "explore" and "dashboard" pages.
* Make onboarding more intuitive.
* Implement drag-and-drop.
* Add more functionality to workspace.
* Look into TripAdvisor API or another travel API.
